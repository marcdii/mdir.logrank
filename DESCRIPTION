Description: Implemented are the one-sided and two-sided 
  multiple-direction logrank test for two-sample right 
  censored data. In addition to the statistics p-values are calculated: 
  1. For the one-sided testing problem one p-value based on a
   wild bootstrap approach is determined. 2. In the two-sided case
   one p-value based on a chi-squared approximation and 
   a second p-valuesvbased on a permutation approach are calculated.
